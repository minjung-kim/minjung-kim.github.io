###Motivation###

The most trivial acts in life are often times unappreciated by their very nature. Naturally, I never thought about breathing outside of the pool. It was trivial and mundane. It wasn't until my high school chemistry class when I learned that our bodies meticulously monitor the carbon dioxide levels in our blood and regulate our pH (7.4 to be exact) by controlling our breathing. Breathing may be trivial, but it was anything but mundane after the lesson on pH. Through the class, I realized that the science behind even the most trivial and mundane observations and activities can result in some of the  most interesting and fascinating answers. When I took biology after chemistry, I started answering small questions: Why does my blood taste like metal? Why does egg go from clear to white when cooked? How do vaccines work?

Occasionally, teachers leave questions unanswered in class because it is beyond the scope of the class. But I was surprised to find that as my questions in biology started to get more complex, sometimes, answers did not exist. I naturally became interested in research as my list of questions grew steadily. 

As an aspiring medical scientist, research is more than a catalyst to maximize my educational experience at the UW. It is an opportunity for me to begin my transition from a curious student to a scientist. Science is based on testable hypotheses and repeatable experiments. As a result, science must be practiced and not just read. Logically, it follows that research is an inseparable part of science. So although books and discussions are important part of any education, I believe that research experience is critical for my education and personal growth as a student of science. Although keeping up with the scientific literature is important, I hope to be more than a reader and become a participant in the larger the scientific community as a researcher.

###HAMM Lab###

When I came to the UW, I jumped at the opportunity to volunteer as a Student Researcher in the Heart and Muscle Mechanics (HAMM) lab freshman year. When I started, I had a very shaky background knowledge in chemistry and biology. Through volunteering at the lab almost daily, attending lab meetings, taking related classes, and having an amazing mentor like my graduate student has allowed me to have a solid understanding of muscle mechanics and related diseases. I've also gained new hard and soft skills

- mutagenesis
- Comassie stain and Western blots
- protein purification using columns
- myosin extraction
- HMM precipitation from myosin
- putting together the troponin complex 
- protein quantification and concentration
- In vitro motility assays

More importantly, I've gained soft skills that I can use outside of lab. I am now more keen on details and patient. I've also become comfortable working independently with occasional supervision for  help with troubleshooting.

####My Project####

Distal Arthrogryposis (DA) is an umbrella term for non progressive congenital skeletal muscle defect characterized by abnormal contractures of the limbs and the face. Some of the more common names for some of the symptoms include club foot and whistle mouth.  It occurs in 1 in every 3,000 live births and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Currently, there are no treatments for the disease, and the patients usually go through regular physical therapy throughout their lifetime. Severe cases require surgical intervention and amputation. One of the more common syndromes is DA 2B, or Sheldon Hall syndrome (SHS), which is caused by mutations in two genes, *TNNI 2* and *TNNT 3* . 
I am particularly interested in studying the R63H mutation that impacts the fast skeletal troponin T (*TNNT 3*) subunit. I will compare the wildtype to the mutated version of *TNNT 3* to observe the differences in calcium sensitivity, ATPase, and maximum filamented actin velocity in a sliding filament assay known as the in vitro motility assay (IVM), to piece together information about how the mutation impacts the overall muscle mechanics.
