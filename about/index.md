Hi, 

My name is Minjung Kim and I am a junior studying Bioengineering at the University of Washington. Some of you may know me personally and others not, but thank you all for taking the time to read my portfolio! This is a place for me to unpack and reflect on and share the experiences I've had at the UW. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about any of the content on this website.
